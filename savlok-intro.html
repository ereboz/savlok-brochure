                <h4>Sav-Lok to the Rescue</h4>

                <p>
                    Mention the word padlock and visions of a body and shackle come to mind. Even Chinese padlocks
                    from centuries ago have much the ame body/shackle arrangement. It has often been said that there
                    is not much new under the sun when it comes to padlocks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another distinct characteristic of most padlocks is that they are only firmly attached to something
                    when they are locked. When the shackle is open, a padlock can be either loosly hooked onto
                    the locking fixture such as a hasp, or it can be removed completely. In either case, most padlocks
                    are susceptible to being misplaced, lost or stolen if they are not relocked back onto their
                    chair or hasp.

                    New Sav Lok kits from Hodge Products, Inc. easily solves the lost padlock problem. Hodge Products, Inc.
                    began in 1971 as a manufacturer and distributor of parts for the solid waste industry. They also have
                    become a world competitor in the distribution of padlocks from all major manufactures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hodge Products found that the loss of valuable padlocks was of rising concern to their customers.
                    Their solution was Sav Lok, a system for permanently attaching a chain assembly to padlock shackles.
                    The Sav Lok design of versatility and strength is what sets it above other similar products on the
                    market. Sav Lok can be quickly and easily installed without any modifications of the lock shackle.
                    No welding is necessary.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sav Lok kits are available for shackle thicknesses of 9/32", 5/16", 3/8", 7/16", and 1/2". Six
                    different kits are available: Sav Lok with no chain, Sav Lok with both chain and installation loop,
                    Sav Lok with chain only, Sav Lok with ring and installation loop and Sav Lok with chain less pop rivets.
                    Except as noted, all Sav Lok kits are furnished with both peen rivets and pop rivets to suit owners
                    choice during installation.

                <h4>Assembly Procedure</h4>
                <p>
                    Sav Lok consists of three primary parts: two lock plates and a spacer. With the padlock unlocked,
                    slip one lock plate onto the shackle. Next, slide the spacer onto the shackle, followed by the second
                    lock plate. Slots in each lock plate allow easy installation of whatever fastener has been ordered.
                    Either the end link of chain, the end loop of aircraft cable or the steel 'O' ring can be installed
                    at this time. The lock plates are then moved together in a scissor action which encases the fastener.
                    The final step is to install either the pop rivets or the peen rivets to complete the installation.
                    Once the Sav Lok is installed it is permanently fastened and cannot slide off of the shackle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Installation is completed by fastening the other end of the chain or cable with the loop part or with
                    a bolt or fixture of hte owners choice. Sav Lok is a simple, effective way to quickly solve lost padlock
                    problems. Hodge Products can also furnish new padlocks pre-installed with Sav Lok Kits.
